# :bento: Grab-dat-Sushi - The Sequel(ize) :bento:

### Grab-dat-Sushi lets you grab some sushi conveyor belt style.  It functions the same way as the original but uses sequelize instead of a custom-made ORM.

**You can put the sushi back on the conveyor belt if you change your mind but please don't nibble it first!**  
**You can also place a custom order with the sushi chef and it will end up on the conveyor belt for you.**
